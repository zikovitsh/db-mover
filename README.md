## 🚀 Overview

**DB Mover** is an open-source tool designed to simplify the complex process of database migration. It eliminates the need for complex CLI commands, connection strings wrestling, and manual dump file management.

With **DB Mover**, you can stream multi-cloud enterprise datasets with absolute precision, zero structural loss, and sub-second latency. It provides a visual interface to connect, select, and move your data effortlessly.

## ✨ Features

- **🚫 No CLI Required**: Stop wrestling with `mongodump` and `psql` flags. Connect your databases via a clean UI.
- **⚡ Direct Transfer**: Stream data directly from source to destination. No intermediate local storage required.
- **📦 Easy Backups**: One-click download of your entire database structure and data as a compressed archive.
- **🔒 Secure**: Your credentials and data never touch our persistent storage (ephemeral processing).
- **👁️ Live Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and logs for every collection and document transferred.
